	<<< Change Log >>>
04/15/2018
	* Dockerfile folder is created and Dockefile.petram-base are Dockerfile.petram
	  are added.
02/19/2018
	* ncface and nodal_refinement is added
	* tested only using 3D RF waveguide.
	
02/12/2018
	* std_solver_model supports saving ParMesh file
	* new dof_map is added, which will replace old mappers.
	
02/08/2018
	* extra contribution is assembled as matrix. Physics module must return t2
	as vertical (transposed).This is due to Hypre
	
02/07/2018
	* partial_mesh is added. This tool generate a new mesh object which contains
	only a boundary with a given attributes.
   	 petram.mesh.partial_mesh.surface(mesh, index, filename = '', precision=8)
           mesh: input mesh
	   index: surface attribute (bdr for 3Din3D, domain for 2Din3D and 2Din2D mesh)

01/12/2018
	* mfem_viewer is change to skip refinement steps
	* (perhaps, I should add an option to look refined mesh, for
	   adavptive meshing)
01/02/2018
	* Worked on Coeff2D. Diffusion term, Essential, Point source, Point Value, Natural
	are written
	* Coeff2D:PointValue is implemented using Lagrange multiplier and DeltaCoefficient
	* engine is fixed to work with real value problem
	* Lagrange multiplier can be array distributed among nodes.
	* call to verify_setting is added in engine so that it checks setting before assembling
	the matrix. In order to use this, each module shoud implement verify_setting method.
	* _sel_index=-1 indicates not to restrict coefficient.

        ** fixed sel_button to work with mixed triangle and quad surfaces.
	
11/14/2017
	** fixed refine=1 when loading mesh file for visualization.
	** fixed EM2Da_PEC, EM3D_PEC. These BC now apply Et=0 properly w/o relying
	   on the initialization of solution vector by engine.
	** various improvement of dialog link behaviors.
        ** EM2Da_ExtJ is added for volumetric current source.
	** Dynamic loading of all installed physics modules 
11/07/2017
	** gl_plot_sol and mfem_viewer is modefided to handle a geometry which
	uses different types of elements.
	** many updates made to support em2da is merged to master
	
09/20/2017
        ** merged scripts in project tree and remote coonections
	Remote connection functionality is rewritten to be universal.
	Server side scripts should absorb the difference between
	remote servers.

	Toggle edge/point buttons are added
	Selecting vertex shows the vertex coordinates on the status
	bar.

	** Geometry building is reorganized to a list of geometry creation
	commads

        object created from givn coordinates
           Point/Circle/Rect/Line/Polygon
        object created from given entities
           Spline -> Points to Spline
           CreateLine -> Points to multiple Lines
           LineLoop -> Lines to LineLoop
           CreateSurface -> Lines to PlaneSurface
           SurfaceLoop -> Surfacess to SurfaceLoops
           CreateVolume ->  Surfacess to Volume
 	object manipulation
           Extrude/Revolve
        boolean operation
           Union/Intersection/Difference/Fragments

	** sample waveguide model is added which uses all Geometry/Mesh/Physics
	segments and solves the problem using serial/parallel solvers.

	** plotting panel is fixed to use a new indexed-vertex mode of solid
	   function. 
	
08/01/2017

	** Geometry building interface is added for testing an idea...
	
07/24/2017

	** Initial value setting for TH3Ds was added.
	
07/22/2017

	** Arrow plot resampling
        - resampling the data to reduce the number of arrows to a
	practical (~300) level
	- a user can specifiy the number of arrow
	- keep face separated is eliminated since we want to make the
	arrow length consistent among surfaces.
	
07/21/2017

	** multiple selection in piScope is enabled
	- a user can select domain and change the surface color at once.
	- this makes a production of final graphics easier using the following
	steps...
	1) use "select Volume"
	2) copy selected faces
	3) open a new window (change 3D axes mode, set gl shading..)
	4) paste the copied faces
	5) open property panel and change color.

	** Other piScope enhancement
	- OIT (order independent transparency) renderer is enabled.
	- Videoplayer button relocation.

	** Initial value from file and inital value from init panel is added
	- Initial value panel of EM3D module works now.
	- Reading initial values from file works only when the file structure
	is the same. (previous simulation should be run with the same CPU
	count and the same mesh). This is meant for a simple restart
	capability. Features such as an interpolation from course mesh is not
	supported.
	
07/20/2017

	** initialization step was cleaned for future expansion

	- InitialValue branch is added in model tree
	- InitialValue branch can hold multiple InitSetting
	- StdSolver has a text box to selecto InitSetting
	- comma separated names can be used to select multiple InitSetting
	- If no InitSetting is specifid, StdSolver allocate all fespace/sol
    	vector and initialize to zero. If this is not desired, one has to
	use NoInitialization in InitSetting
	- StdSolver saves solfiles when init_only mode is selected
	- Physics setting panels has thrid Init/NL panel, where a user can
	set domain/boundary specfic initial values.
	- THIS CHANGES  are NOT important for RF-only modeling. It will be
	useful for in a multiphysics case
	
07/19/2017
	
	** Significant reduction of GUI handling code length using
	petram.phys.vtable

	** reset_model menu in mfem_viewer shows a confirmation dialog
	to avoid deleting a model tree by mistake.

	** When setting up mfem_eofe module using setupmodel command, a
	newly created model now has server setting to eofe.
	-  a user still need to make a new work directory.
	

07/15-07/18/2017
	

	** A problem of server side data processing is fixed.
	
	** Selecting multiple surface and adding them to domain/boundary
	selection work now.

	** A problem of not closing threads and processing when a
	communication channel is closed is fixed.
	- number of threads shown at the right bottom corner of
	piScope window goes back to 1 after the connection is closed.

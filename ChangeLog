	Change Log
	* 07/21/2017

	** multiple selection in piScope is enabled
	- a user can select domain and change the surface color at once.
	- this makes a production of final graphics easier using the following
	steps...
	1) use "select Volume"
	2) copy selected faces
	3) open a new window (change 3D axes mode, set gl shading..)
	4) paste the copied faces
	5) open property panel and change color.
	
	* 07/20/2017

	** initialization step was cleaned for future expansion

	- InitialValue branch is added in model tree
	- InitialValue branch can hold multiple InitSetting
	- StdSolver has a text box to selecto InitSetting
	- comma separated names can be used to select multiple InitSetting
	- If no InitSetting is specifid, StdSolver allocate all fespace/sol
    	vector and initialize to zero. If this is not desired, one has to
	use NoInitialization in InitSetting
	- StdSolver saves solfiles when init_only mode is selected
	- Physics setting panels has thrid Init/NL panel, where a user can
	set domain/boundary specfic initial values.
	- THIS CHANGES  are NOT important for RF-only modeling. It will be
	useful for in a multiphysics case
	
	* 07/19/2017
	
	** Significant reduction of GUI handling code length using
	petram.phys.vtable

	** reset_model menu in mfem_viewer shows a confirmation dialog
	to avoid deleting a model tree by mistake.

	** When setting up mfem_eofe module using setupmodel command, a
	newly created model now has server setting to eofe.
	-  a user still need to make a new work directory.
	

	* 07/15-07/18/2017
	

	** A problem of server side data processing is fixed.
	
	** Selecting multiple surface and adding them to domain/boundary
	selection work now.

	** A problem of not closing threads and processing when a
	communication channel is closed is fixed.
	- number of threads shown at the right bottom corner of
	piScope window goes back to 1 after the connection is closed.

	** initialization step was cleaned for future expansion

	- InitialValue branch is added in model tree
	- InitialValue branch can hold multiple InitSetting
	- StdSolver has a text box to selecto InitSetting
	- comma separated names can be used to select multiple InitSetting
	- If no InitSetting is specifid, StdSolver allocate all fespace/sol
    	vector and initialize to zero. If this is not desired, one has to
	use NoInitialization in InitSetting
	- StdSolver saves solfiles when init_only mode is selected
	- Physics setting panels has thrid Init/NL panel, where a user can
	set domain/boundary specfic initial values.

	- This changes are not important for RF-only modeling. It will be
	useful for in a multiphysics case

	** Significant reduction of GUI handling code length using
	petram.phys.vtable

	** reset_model menu in mfem_viewer shows a confirmation dialog
	to avoid deleting a model tree by mistake.

	** When setting up mfem_eofe module using setupmodel command, a
	newly created model now has server setting to eofe.
	-  a user still need to make a new work directory.

	** A problem of server side data processing is fixed.
	

	** Selecting multiple surface and adding them to domain/boundary
	selection work now.

	** A problem of not closing threads and processing when a
	communication channel is closed is fixed.

	- number of threads shown at the right bottom corner of
	piScope window goes back to 1 after the connection is closed.
